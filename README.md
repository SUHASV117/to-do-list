# To-do-list app
To-do-list app built with MERN stack. 

I am designing an app for a department where, an admin decides what are the tasks 
that has to be assigned to each employee of the department and also sets the target (in days) 
within which they have to complete the task.

The app webpage contains the following features:

## Features:
1. Name of the employee
2. Email-id of the employee
3. Task name assigned to the employee
4. Target (in days) set for the completion of the task



Also,after the admin enters all the details regarding an employee, he **can send 
an email alert to the concerned employee** intimating him about the task assigned to him and also the set deadline.

All these tasks assigned data entered by admin, will be stored in a backend database of the department using Mongodb.
