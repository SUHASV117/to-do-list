# To-do-list app
To-do-list app built with MERN stack. 

I am designing an app for a department where, an admin decides what are the tasks 
that has to be assigned to each employee of the department and also sets the 
priority of the task

The app webpage contains the following features:

## Features:
1. Name of the Task
2. Employee responsible for the task
3. Priority of the task
4. Email-id of the employee
5. Mobile no. of the employee


Also,after the admin enters all the details regarding an employee, he **can send 
an email alert and also sms alert to the concerned employee** intimating him about the task assigned to him.

All these tasks assigned data entered by admin, will be stored in a backend database of the department using Mongodb.
