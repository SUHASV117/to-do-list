# To-do-list app
To-do-list app built with MERN stack. 

I am designing an app for a department where, an admin decides what are the tasks 
that has to be assigned to each employee of the department and also sends the 
reminder to the concerned employee.

The app webpage contains the following features:

## Features:
1. Employee responsible for the task
2. Name of the Task
3. Email-id of the employee
4. Mobile no. of the employee


Also,after the admin enters all the details regarding an employee, he **can send 
an email alert and also sms alert to the concerned employee** intimating him about the task assigned to him.

All these tasks assigned data entered by admin, will be stored in a backend database of the department using Mongodb



## Steps to Run the application:

```
#In the root directory
npm install

#cd frontend
#npm install

#cd backend
#npm install

#In the root directory
npm start
```
